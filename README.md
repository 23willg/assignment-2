# Assignment 2 (assigned 7/27, due 8/12)

## Lab

### Loop Demo
This is the starter code for this project.  It loads a vector from file and sums each element into a single result.  It then saves the final result.

### Loop Unrolling Demo
The purpose of this portion of the lab is to look into loop unrolling and how it can impact the performance of the code executed.  This is an optimization that can be perfromed by `gcc` and therefore may not have a visible impact.

### ARM Neon Intrinsics Demo
Using the previous code from the loop unrolling section, we should update this to use the ARM Neon intrinsics.  Please see the resources.

## Homework

### Naive Matrix Multiplication (Compare runtime)

### Loop Unrolling (Compare runtime)

### Block Matrix Multiplication (Comare Runtime)

### Arm Vectorization (Compare runtime)
